# About 
quick sort algo is one of the sorting techniques.
also called :
- Selection exchange sort
- partition exchange sort

# Time Complexity

- Worst case --> When it's partitioning is in any end
  - O(n^2)  already sorted.
- Best case --> When it's partitioning is in middle
  - O( nLog n )  

# quick Vs selection sort
In quick sort we select an element and find it's correct position
but in selection sort we select a position and find out element for this position
